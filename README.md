## 😄 About Me

- 🔭 I’m currently working on: "trying to find the perfect balance between `console.log` and `debugger`"
- 🌱 Currently learning: How to actually finish a side project
- 👯 Looking to collaborate on: Creating the next big thing… or a meme-worthy 404 page
- 🤔 Fun fact: If you run `rm -rf /` I might cry, but we can still be friends

## 🚀 My Skills

> JavaScript, but only on days that end in ‘Y’.  
> CSS? More like “Constantly Struggling Syndrome.”  
> React: I react quickly to bugs 🐛  
> TypeScript: 50% of the time, it works every time!  
> Next.js: For when I need things done yesterday

"I’ll call you, maybe!"
